encryption_type = sha256; For a list of encryption types, run print_r(hash_algos());
encryption_iterations = 4000; Basic benchmarks for encryption iterations can be found here: https://defuse.ca/php-pbkdf2.htm
encryption_salt_bytes = 32; 24 is the default for PBKDF2, but the strlen of sha256 is 32 and sha512 is 64, ...
encryption_hash_bytes = 32; so don't go over those or you'll just be wasting cpu cycles
